In order to run Assignment 8, each part of the assignment can be accessed through its specific folder. Running part 1 will display a bar graph visualization, and when clicked the visualization displays the average Austin household electricity usage for each year in the data set. Part 2 is also run just by opening the sketch and clicking the screen to display specific data for each Porsche in the data set. Part 3 is run by opening the sketch and clicking to display different headlines. **Note that running Part 3 requires importing the ControlP5 library from Processing.**
