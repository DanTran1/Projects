In this animation, Group 12 attempted to create a 3D scene depicting the movement of a number of objects in space. Specifically, the objects depicted include a cat floating in an apparently random manner with a red/clear sphere -meant to represent the cat's space helmet- placed around the cat's head, a dog that is in the process of relieving itself, and a teapot that is emitting a small water droplet as it too rotates seemingly aimlessly through space. 

Brett designed the teapot and water droplet animation. The intent was to have a teapot with a water droplet orbiting the teapot (becauseâ€¦ space), and the singular class included handles the display and movement of both the water droplet and the teapot. Unexpected challenges arose when he originally intended for the water droplet to emit from the mouth of the teapot regardless of orientation, but he felt like it made more sense to have a singular water droplet considering this is a space scene and gravity is in question. Dan created the cat as well as the space helmet. The cat class displays an imported 3D object with a red sphere rotating on the cat object's head. If you hover the mouse over the cat's head, you should be able to see the rotation of the sphere a little more clearly. Daniel created the dog as well as the dog's liquid waste. The dog class displays an imported 3D dog object as well as the material and image meshes that give the dog its specific appearance. As can be seen, the dog's sub-animation involves a small stream represented by a box that flows from below the dog to the ground beneath the dog as it is clearly upset by being spun around the infinite vacuum of space.
