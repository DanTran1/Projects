- key 1 will implement a grayscale
- key 2 will implement a contrast filter
- key 3 will implement a blur filter
- key 4 will implement a edge detection filter
- key 5 will implement a red filter


I used the kernel/ matrix to implement any filters that needed neighboring data. Most of the filters work. There are some issues with the edge detection filter. It does not look like the example you showed us in class. I'm not sure what went wrong.
